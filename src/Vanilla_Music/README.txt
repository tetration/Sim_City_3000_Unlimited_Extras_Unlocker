In this folder you are supposed to place the high quality songs included in your original Simcity3000 Vanilla cd in order to upgrade the files in Simcity 3000 Unlimited which are the same audio files, but in lower quality than the vanilla Simcity 3000.

For some unknown reason Simcity 3000 Unlimited has three missing music tracks ('SIM Broadway', 'Concrete Jungle' and 'SimCity 2000 Theme'), that were originally included in Simcity 3000(Vanilla). The option 1 in the Menu of this small Java Script unlocks them. 


Requirements: 
* A Windows or Linux Machine with Simcity 3000 Unlimited installed in them(obviously)

*Original copy of Simcity 3000 (Vanilla not the Unlimited Edition), in order to transfer their high quality soundtrack to your Simcity 3000 Unlimited

*Java SE 8 installed in your computer(Linux or Windows)

*Java SE 8 Developer Kit installed in your pc(Linux or Windows)


Unlocking High Quality Soundtrack in Simcity 3000 Unlimited

Steps:
1: Make sure to transfer the files(from your original Simcity 3000 vanilla in the directory res/sound/music) you which to upgrade in your simcity 3000 Unlimited are placed in Vanilla_Music Folder and are with uppercase, otherwise the transference wont work

3KG2.XA = "SIM Broadway" 
3KJ1M.XA = "Updown Town" 
3KJ2M.XA = "Night Life" 
3KJ3M.XA = "South Bridge" 
3KJ4M.XA = "Central Park Sunday" 
3KP3M.XA = "Illumination" 
3KP5M.XA = "Concrete Jungle" 


2: Place the src folder along with all its directories inside the main directory in your Simcity 3000 Unlimited

3:Run the terminal(Linux version)/cmd(Windows version) and type the CD command until you are in the main directory of Simcity 3000 Unlimited, then in the src folder inside the main directory of Simcity 3000 Unlimited

4: Once inside the src folder(with the .java file in it) type in the terminal/cmd javac Simcity3000_extras.java 
(Warning this step will only work if you have Java OracleÂ´s Developer kit installed!!!)

5:Now type in the terminal/cmd java Simcity3000_extras(without the .java) and the program will start if you have done everything correctly!)

6: Use the menu to install the new features!
